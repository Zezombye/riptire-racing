# Riptire Racing

Old gamemode which I updated a little for the Elo Hell throwdown. Made with [overpy](https://github.com/Zezombye/overpy).

I won't work on it anymore, feel free to fork it and add new maps. Obviously don't steal the credit though.

To go in build mode, define BUILD_MODE to true in main.opy.

Ideas I had were:
- Moving beams
- Beams that kill you (or deal damage to you)
- Beams that slow you down or speed you up
- Beams that make your aim speed lower/higher
- Beams that make your size lower/higher
- Random items like Mario Kart
